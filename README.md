## Brief

"In this project, youâ€™ll be coming up with your own topic for a final project. This is your chance to bring together everything that you have learned so far to showcase your skills."

## Concept & Implementation

For this project, I wanted to create a full-functioning blog/forum. Along with a store, it's probably the most common type of website out there. I wanted to use Redux here again to manage state, and make it more interactive so it feels like your comments and reactions happen in real-time without refreshing the page. 

It was quite blank until I settled on the historical figure theme - it felt a little tongue-in-cheek but at the same time a good "pratical" demonstration of the application.

## General Thoughts

I felt pretty confident in everything here. I was so much quicker implmenting everything that I'd done previously, I really understood how each of the parts of the stack work together and with each other. 

I even created a small text editor to populate comments with, which I'm pretty proud of. It uses Markdown to display itself. It's not *entirely* error free however, so I'm definitely going to improve it on my next project - and maybe add an emoji button in the future.

## Known issues

* Sometimes the text editor doesn't know where the cursor is / puts things in the wrong place
* Not optimised for mobile

## Planned Improvements:

* Mobile version // possibly even a React Native version
* Ordering comments
* Admin abilities / roles (review reports etc.)
* More data validation in app / express
